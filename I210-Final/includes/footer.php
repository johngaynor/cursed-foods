    <h6>
        Any ill effect to the body after the consumption of our food including
        but not limited to nausea, pain, loss of will to live, projectile
        vomiting, diarrhea, feeling cursed, 7 years of bad luck, loss of motor
        function, internal bleeding, intestinal failure, organ failure, blocked
        intestines, ruptured appendix, stomach rot, and general discomfort, is
        simply a mere coincidence, (but you should probably see a doctor.)
